Such disruption increases the    execution time and in some cases restrain the mobile devices from    getting execution results from the cloud. This research work analyzes    the impact of user mobility on the execution of cloud-based mobile    applications. We propose a Process State Synchronization (PSS)based    execution management to solve the aforementioned problem. We    analytically compute a sufficient condition on synchronization interval    that ensure reduction in mobile application execution time under PSS in    case of disconnection. Similarly, we compute the upper bound on    synchronization interval whereby a larger synchronization interval did    not result in significant benefits in terms of execution time for the    mobile application. The analytical results were confirmed by the sample    implementation of PSS with the computed synchronization intervals.    Moreover, we also compare the performance of proposed solution with the    state-of-the-art solutions.

The routing    must avoid forwarding packets through segments with low network density    and high scale of network disconnections that may result in packet loss,    delays, and increased communication overhead in route recovery.    Therefore, both traffic and segment status must be considered. This    paper presents real-time intersection-based segment aware routing    (RTISAR), an intersection-based segment aware algorithm for geographic    routing in VANETs. This routing algorithm provides an optimal route for    forwarding the data packets toward their destination by considering the    traffic segment status when choosing the next intersection. RTISAR    presents a new formula for assessing segment status based on    connectivity, density, load segment, and cumulative distance toward the    destination.

As a result, this mechanism minimizes    the communication overhead generated during the segment status    computation process. Simulations are performed to evaluate RTISAR, and    the results are compared with those of intersection-based connectivity    aware routing and traffic flow-oriented routing.

However,    due to the lack of intelligence in the traditional transportation    system, it takes a lot of resources to manually retrieve and locate the    queried objects from a large number of images. In order to solve this    issue, we propose an effective method for query-based object    localization, which uses artificial intelligence techniques to    automatically locate the queried object in complex backgrounds. The    proposed method is termed as Fine-grained and Progressive Attention    Localization Network (FPAN), which uses an image and a queried object as    input to accurately locate the target object in the image. Specifically,    the fine-grained attention module is naturally embedded into each layer    of a convolution neural network (CNN), thereby gradually suppressing the    regions that are irrelevant to the queried object and eventually    focusing attention on the target area. We further employ top-down    attentions fusion algorithm operated by a learnable cascade up-sampling    structure to establish the connection between the attention map and the    exact location of the queried object in the original image. Furthermore,    the FPAN is trained by multi-task learning with box segmentation loss    and cosine loss. At last, we conduct comprehensive experiments on both    queried-based digit localization and object tracking with synthetic and    benchmark datasets.

By achieving an efficient spectrum sharing among    H-STN, traffic offloading is a promising solution for boosting the    capacity of traditional cellular networks. In this paper, a    software-defined network-based spectrum sharing, and traffic offloading    mechanism is proposed to realize the cooperation and competition between    the ground base stations (BSs) of the cellular network and beam groups    of the satellite-terrestrial communication (STCom) system. Assume that    all BSs are operated by the same mobile network operator (MNO). Under    the cooperation mode, all the BSs stop occupying a corresponding    channel, and a selected beam group of the satellite helps offload the    traffic from the BSs by exclusively using this channel. To facilitate    the offloading negotiation between the MNO and satellite, we design a    second-price auction mechanism which presents positive allocative    externalities, i.e., other uncooperative beam groups of the satellite    can benefit from the cooperation between BSs and the beam group    performing offloading. Meanwhile, the unique optimal biding strategies    for different beam groups of the satellite to achieve the symmetric    Bayesian equilibrium as well as the expected utility of the MNO are    derived and obtained in this paper.

Its main purpose is to extract the different features    of vehicles from videos or pictures captured by traffic surveillance so    as to identify the types of vehicles, and then provide reference    information for traffic monitoring and control. In this paper, we    propose a step-forward vehicle-detection and -classification method    using a saliency map and the convolutional neural-network (CNN)    technique. Specifically, compressed-sensing (CS) theory is applied to    generate the saliency map to label the vehicles in an image, and the CNN    scheme is then used to classify them. We applied the concept of the    saliency map to search the image for target vehicles: this step is based    on the use of the saliency map to minimize redundant areas. CS was used    to measure the image of interest and obtain its saliency in the    measurement domain. Because the data in the measurement domain are much    smaller than those in the pixel domain, saliency maps can be generated    at a low computation cost and faster speed. Then, based on the saliency    map, we identified the target vehicles and classified them into    different types using the CNN.

However, in this sophisticated system,    security and privacy issues are major concerns that hinder the    widespread adoptions of these novel techniques. In this paper, we focus    on assured data deletion, an issue that is important but received less    attention in academia and industry.

Only data owners and fog devices are    involved when deleting cloud data and validating the deletion of these    data, which makes the protocol practical due to the features of low    latency as well as real-time interaction with fog.

Agentless periodic filesystem    monitors are optimal solutions to protect cloud virtual machines because    of the secure and low-overhead features. However, most of the periodic    monitors usually scan all of the virtual machine filesystem or protected    files in every scanning poll, so lots of secure files are scanned again    and again even though they are not corrupted. In this paper, we propose    a novel agentless periodic filesystem monitor framework for virtual    machines with different image formats to improve the performance of    agentless periodic monitors. Our core idea is to minimize the scope of    the scanning files in both file integrity checking and virus detection.    In our monitor, if a file is considered secure, it will not be scanned    when it has not been modified. Since our monitor only scans the newly    created and modified files, it can check fewer files than other    filesystem monitors. To that end, we propose two monitor methods for    different types of virtual machine disks to reduce the number of    scanning files. For virtual machine with single disk image, we hook the    backend driver to capture the disk modification information. For virtual    machine with multiple copy-on-write images, we leverage the    copy-on-write feature of QCOW2 images to achieve the disk modification    analysis. In addition, our system can restore and remove the corrupted    files.

The numerical and field    experiment results have verified that the proposed ATML can locate    multiple MSNs simultaneously with high accuracy and efficiency by    exploiting the spread spectrum gain and antenna array gain.

Therefore, we propose a    framework for vehicle tracking with multimodal data fusion.    Specifically, we fuse the results of two modalities, images and    velocities, in our vehicle-tracking task. Images, being processed in the    module of vehicle detection, provide visual information about the    features of vehicles, whereas velocity estimation can further evaluate    the possible locations of the target vehicles, which reduces the number    of candidates being compared, decreasing the time consumption and    computational cost.
